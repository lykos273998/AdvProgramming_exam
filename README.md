# ADV Programming project
**Group** : Marianna Corsano, Francesco Tomba, Samuele Maria Semi

Git repository for the *Advanced Programming Exam* @ University of Trieste, AY 2020/21

## Project Description
The project consists in 2 parts, `c++` and `python`.
The `c++` part consist in the implementation of a BST and the `python` one in an algorithm to build a "reversed dictionary".

## Compile and run
For the `c++` part it comes with a makefile which compiles `bst_test.cpp` a simple file that performs some tests on the implementation, if you want to compile by yourself use:
```makefile
g++ bst_test.cpp -I Include -Wall -Wextra -o [executable name]
```
The `python` part comes in a jupyter notebook, for further testing it needs `pytest` package.
